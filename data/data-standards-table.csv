Australia's IMOS Animal Tracking Facility,University of Tasmania,,,"Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) Ocean Data Network includes data collections for Acoustic Telemetry, which uses a continental-scale array of strategically placed underwater acoustic receivers and a central data repository to monitor and track broad-scale movements of tagged animals, and Animal Tagging, which deploys satellite-relayed transmitters equipped with miniaturised oceanographic sensors on marine species (i.e. seals, and sea turtles ) to collect behavioural (movements, dive behaviour) and physical (depth, temperature and salinity) data.",https://imos.org.au/facility/animal-tracking,data platform
Biologging intelligent Platform,University of Tokyo,Katsufumi Sato,,"Using a fund from ""Application of big data of marine life (program manager Tom Akamatsu)"" by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan, we have established a new biologging data base ""Biologging intelligent Platform"". There are several biologging databases in the world, a few data are uploaded from Japanese scientists. Japanese researchers have developed a variety of data loggers to measure not only position data but also various parameters such as depth, temperature, velocity, acceleration, and geomagnetism. Most existing biologging databases specialized for location data. It was difficult to upload such diverse time series data. It might be a reason why Japanese researchers hesitate to upload their data to the existing databases. To solve this situation, the BiP was developed. An important feature of BiP is the ability to store a variety of data in a standard format.",www.bip-earth.com/,data platform
Biological Ubiquitous Network ,Druid Technology,Lin Yan and Guozheng Li,,"Comprehensive digitalization of the animal and environment becomes more and more important for scientific society and sustainable development of the world. Establishment of an ubiquitous network for transmitting the multidimensional data of animals, such as location, surrounding environment, behaviour, audio, and video etc., can facilitate the efficiency of data acquisition. Despite existing cellular networks and developing satellite networks, a natural network is the people's engagement with their smartphones.

COVID-19 Bio-logging Initiative,International Bio-Logging Society,Federico Ossi,,"The COVID 19 Bio-logging Initiative was initiated in early 2020 during the first phases of the pandemic. A restricted group of scientists, all members of the International Bio-logging Society, set up the Initiative to collect data from the whole globe in order to evaluate the response of wildlife to the so called ‚ÄòAnthropause‚Äô (a term which was invented by the same group of scientists and published in a Science paper in 2020). Since then, more than 500 people joined the Initiative, the most of which providing access to their bio-logging data (mostly GPS). Within the Initiative, several sub-projects have been identified and taken over by 1-2 leaders who are members of the Steering Committee. Since 2022, the Initiative has been funded by the Moore Foundation, which gave the possibility to hire three postdocs working full time on the topics. From a practical perspective, there is not a proper database with all collected and cleaned datasets. However, there is a dataset with links to the data provided by data owners, divided by species and region, so querying the areas of interest is relatively easy. Targeted databases have been then created by the data analysts of the sub-projects. There is a Steering Committee formed by ca. 15 scientists. The Chair is Christian Rutz. Federico Ossi is the person in charge of communication. Others have different roles, spanning from leading subprojects to helping with data curation.

The resulting datasets can provide powerful detailed information on species behavioral adaptability in response to climate variation and inform conservation (see for example Chimienti et al. 2022).
