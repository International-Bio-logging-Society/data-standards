Visualizing Life in the Deep,"Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego",Jessica Kendall-Bar,,"This workshop and poster review some of our nascent current efforts to transform a series of bespoke animation tools (paper [Full Text], Coursera course, examples, & Github) into a web browser tool for biologging scientists to better visualize multimodal (diving + GPS + physiology + behavioral) data, automate behavioral labeling, review model performance, and generate insights. This project would greatly benefit from a shared ontology and the implementation of data standards for higher resolution diving and physiology data (not just tracking data) such as databases and APIs like the one we have implemented for our app (see sample API here).",

Swedish Biologging data - WRAM & SBDI,"Dept. of Wildlife, Fish, and Environmental Studies, Swe.University of Agricultural Sciences",Petter Lundberg,,"WRAM – Wireless Remote Animal Monitoring – a national infrastructure for biologging, designed to facilitate bio-logging data capture, storage and visualisation. WRAM is one of the pillars of SBDI – the Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure. SBDI is Sweden’s largest freely available biodiversity database, bringing in data from various national sources. SBDI is the Swedish node of GBIF. Within SBDI there is a collaboration between WRAM and CAnMove (Lund University) to develop a common database with a common biologging data standard aimed to be general to be able to encompass data from any sensor type. Our biologging sensor data model is documented here: https://github.com/biodiversitydata-se/biologging-sensor-datamodel.

"Large, heterogeneous, high-resolution bio-logging datasets informing conservation: new challenges and opportunities for data standardization and analysis.","Laboratoire L3i, Pôle Sciences et Technologie, Equipe Prédateurs Marins / Marine Predators Team, Centre d’Etudes Biologiques de Chizé (CEBC), CNRS-La Rochelle Université",Marianna Chimienti,,"High-resolution bio-logging data (e.g. accelerometer and video data) have been collected worldwide across species and ecosystems. The resulting datasets can provide powerful detailed information on species behavioral adaptability in response to climate variation and inform conservation (see for example Chimienti et al. 2022 and work in review presented at BLS8). Yet, we are lacking data standardization and data sharing practice to be able to further develop analytical tools able to process data across species and ecosystems, as well as promote interoperability and collaborations between scientists across disciplines (e.g. theoretical and applied ecology, engineer, computer science and data science).",
COVID-19 Bio-logging Initiative,"There is a Steering Committee formed by ca. 15 scientists. The Chair is Christian Rutz. Federico Ossi is the person in charge of communication. Others have different roles, spanning from leading subprojects to helping with data curation. ",Federico Ossi,,"The COVID 19 Bio-logging Initiative was initiated in early 2020 during the first phases of the pandemic. A restricted group of scientists, all members of the International Bio-logging Society, set up the Initiative to collect data from the whole globe in order to evaluate the response of wildlife to the so called ‘Anthropause’ (a term which was invented by the same group of scientists and published in a Science paper in 2020). Since then, more than 500 people joined the Initiative, the most of which providing access to their bio-logging data (mostly GPS). Within the Initiative, several sub-projects have been identified and taken over by 1-2 leaders who are members of the Steering Committee. Since 2022, the Initiative has been funded by the Moore Foundation, which gave the possibility to hire three postdocs working full time on the topics. From a practical perspective, there is not a proper database with all collected and cleaned datasets. However, there is a dataset with links to the data provided by data owners, divided by species and region, so querying the areas of interest is relatively easy. Targeted databases have been then created by the data analysts of the sub-projects. ",

Unique Animal IDs,Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior,Martin Wiskelski,,"Researchers are monitoring more animals for longer and collecting a range of multi-media information about individuals throughout their lives. In addition to the sensor recordings themselves, information can come from photographs, text messages and news articles. Further, as more projects are shared and archived, we see a need to be able to recognize individuals across datasets to enable future efforts to bring together data globally. To address these challenges, we have launched the Movebank Life History Museum (MoMu) and Unique Animal Identifier (UAID) system to store accessory files related to tracked wildlife and assign persistent and unique identifiers for animals. Please visit https://animaltracker.app and to participate in beta testing of these new tools.",
Biological Ubiquitous Network ,Druid Technology,Lin Yan and Guozheng Li,,"Comprehensive digitalization of the animal and environment becomes more and more important for scientific society and sustainable development of the world. Establishment of an ubiquitous network for transmitting the multidimensional data of animals, such as location, surrounding environment, behaviour, audio, and video etc., can facilitate the efficiency of data acquisition. Despite existing cellular networks and developing satellite networks, a natural network is the people's engagement with their smartphones.

Systematic review of open biologging data,none,Max Czapanskiy ,,"How many species have we tracked with biologists? What’s the relative frequency of sensors we use? Most importantly, where do data end up after publication? These foundational questions are currently unanswerable, due to inconsistent publishing practices in our field. We are conducting a systematic review of biologging studies published 2007-2023 to create the first ever biologging bibliometric database. This work will establish a baseline for the state of open biologging data. Future work by this working group and other efforts will be able to use our database to test the effectiveness of their interventions. ",

Biologging intelligent Platform,University of Tokyo,Katsufumi Sato,,"Using a fund from “Application of big data of marine life (program manager Tom Akamatsu)” by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan, we have established a new biologging data base “Biologging intelligent Platform”. There are several biologging databases in the world, a few data are uploaded from Japanese scientists. Japanese researchers have developed a variety of data loggers to measure not only position data but also various parameters such as depth, temperature, velocity, acceleration, and geomagnetism. Most existing biologging databases specialized for location data. It was difficult to upload such diverse time series data. It might be a reason why Japanese researchers hesitate to upload their data to the existing databases. To solve this situation, the BiP was developed. An important feature of BiP is the ability to store a variety of data in a standard format.",
